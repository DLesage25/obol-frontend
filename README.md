# Obol Frontend Challenge
This is a home assesment for frontend candidates

## Intro
Today, we're going to construct a country of the world app!  This assignment allows you to demonstrate your experience with NextJS and CSS.

## Assignment
Given a data API located here: https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2-all.  Build an app in NextJS that meets the requirements below.

## Requirements
- displays a list of the countries using a component CountryCard for display
- allows you to click the country card, and display the countries' profile ("region, capital city and population (and any other extra info you'd like to add)")
- allows you to search for a specific country by name

Use: https://restcountries.com/v2/name/{name}  ({name being the country name}) for searching the name
Use: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all to get all the countries

## Extra
- What does code quality look like to you? Show us with your code! If you have an eye for design, impress us with your CSS powers! and tools to request data like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/?from=reactQueryV3&original=https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/)

# Getting Started with Create Next App

This project needs to be bootstrapped with [Create NextJs App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Let's Get Started:
1. Clone this repository 
2. If you don't have node installed download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/
3. Go to the root directory of the repository in your command line boostrap the project with [Create NextJs App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).
4. Run npm start, and it should load a basic rendered page in your default browser
5. Do periodically commits and use `feature/` branches for commits, please read git flow -> https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
6. Once you finish, made a PR to main branch on this repo.
5. You're ready to code!

# Steps

### `nvm use`
### `yarn && yarn dev`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` when project is build

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


# Important things to use

1. Typescript
2. [Stitches.dev](https://stiches.dev) for the styling
3. [Atomic design pattern](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)
3. Upload this to netlify site

# Optional but cool stuff that you can use
